			Are you already a developer, but would like to learn iOS? Or maybe you're
			already an iOS developer that would like to go to the next level. After a
			quick chat where we'll understand your needs, we'll tailor a learning plan
			just for you. The suggested frequency is of 2â€“3 times/week, but daily is
			also an option.
