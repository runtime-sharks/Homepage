	<ul>
		<li>one who excels greatly, especially in a particular field;
		<li>an aquatic apex predator, that has been around for over 400 million years;
		<li><em>[Some might say]</em> a rapacious/greedy crafty person who takes advantage of others.
	</ul>

	<p>
		Don't be mistaken by the last one: we <em>are</em> greedy, but for great user experience; we <em>take advantage</em>, but of all the tools at our disposal to create great products, and we're astute <em>[crafty]</em> about it.
	</p>

	<p>
		Our primary goal is for our users to have the best possible experience <em>[at runtime]</em>, and we will do anything in our power to do so <em>[like a shark]</em>.
