		<p>This application collects some Personal Data from its users. </p>

		<p><strong>Data Controller and Processor:</strong> </p>

		<p>Name: Runtime Sharks SRL</p>

		<p>Contact email: privacy@runtimesharks.com</p>

		<p><strong>Types of Data collected</strong></p>

		<p>Among the types of Personal Data that this Application collects, by itself or through third parties, there are: Cookies and Usage Data.</p>

		<p>The Personal Data may be freely provided by the User, or, in case of Usage Data, collected automatically when using this Application.</p>

		<p><strong>Mandatory Personal Data</strong></p>

		<ul>
			<li>When creating an account, the User is required to provide a username, a name and an email, without which the service can not be offered. If the Data becomes obsolete, or a mistake has been made, the User can edit its profile information through the Application's settings.</li>
		</ul>

		<p><strong>Indirect mandatory Personal Data</strong></p>

		<ul>
			<li>When another user follows the User, we will store and display this relation on both users' profiles. Even though the User has taken no action, there is no way to block other users from performing this action, because user profiles are public and can be seen, searched and followed by anyone using the service.</li>
			<li>When another user follows the User, they will be able to see all of the User's public posts. If the User would like to keep any story or entry information private, they can mark it as private, as described below.</li>
			<li>The User has the option to block another User — this way, both of them will stop seeing each other, as well as their stories and entries.</li>
		</ul>

		<p><strong>Optional Personal Data</strong></p>

		<p>The User can, at its free will, provide optional Personal Data, which is not required to run the service:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>After creating an account, the User has the possibility to upload a profile picture.</li>
			<li>When creating a story, the User is required to provide a title, a date and mark it as public or private. While this information <strong>is</strong> required in relation to this action, the User can choose not to create any stories, or mark it as private.</li>
			<li>When creating an entry, the User is required to provide a picture, a title, a location, a description and mark it as public or private. An entry can also be marked as a &quot;cover&quot;, which means the story that contains it will display its photo. While this information <strong>is</strong> required in relation to this action, the User can choose not to create any entries, or mark them as private.</li>
			<li>When adding a &quot;like&quot; to a story or entry, we will store and display the fact that that User has now &quot;liked&quot; that story or entry. The User can choose not to like any stories, nor entries.</li>
			<li>When following/unfollowing another user, we will store and display the relation between the User and the other user on both users' profiles. The User can choose not to follow any other users.</li>
		</ul>

		<p>The User can choose to not perform any of these actions, however, this will limit their interaction with the Application — one of its main purposes is to interact with other users.</p>

		<p>After any of this Data has been created, if the User desires their Data be excluded from being processed until they give their consent again, the User can deactivate their account. Any Data related to a deactivated account will be hidden from search results and feeds, and the account will be unusable. The User is required to give consent again, by requesting the reactivation of the account, on the next login attempt.</p>

		<p>The User can mark any story and any entry as being private — these will not be searchable by other users, won't be seen on other users' feeds and will not be visible on the User's profile.</p>
